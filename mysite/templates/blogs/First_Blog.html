                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Web development is a valuable, highly sought after skill. One that helps set technicians apart from one another. 
                                        Recently, I've been interested in the idea of getting better with my web development skills, and finally putting together a website.
                                        I have an understanding of HTML, CSS, and some Javascript from highschool, in addition to learning a little bit of Python on my own. I realized the kind of site I'd want would take a little more than hand-coding every page, as the site would be too big to manage before too long, so I looked to a CMS (content management system) to try and resolve my issue, and decided on Django CMS. My reasoning was I wanted to have SOME control over how my site functioned, and maintain some level of challenge.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">So I started down the path of learning Django CMS, and maybe I'm just a newbie and it shines brighter than I realize, but I can't help but feel as though certain aspects of Django CMS are made a little harder than necessary. 
                                        For starters it can't generate new pages the way something like Wordpress can, and it's more akin to a customizeable text box than any customizeable page I've ever seen before.
                                        what frustrates me is that I have seen plenty of demo screenshots swearing by the ease of Django CMS, but I have not seen many tutorials that actually cover the same things these screenshots are promising.
                                        Which brings me to the learning and tutorial side of this CMS. 
                                        Maybe I wasn't looking in the right spots, but it seemed to me like all the tutorials that I have found are either not incredibly clear in their explanation, or the tutorial is possibly so outdated that the information covered doesn't apply anymore.
                                        As an example of what I'm talking about, I found a tutorial site for DjangoCMS that had two different articles with almost identical titles, but only one would install Django CMS onto your machine. The other one installed vanilla Django, but the steps are nearly identical
                                    
                                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Now don't get me wrong, Python is a great programming language, and Django CMS is an excellent backend system that's allowed me a server to test and rework my front end presentation, but depending on what one wants to do, it may be a little clunky.</p>
                                    
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">For example, Django CMS allows users to use HTML, and CSS templates to lay out their site however they see fit, <b>BUT</b> in order for these templates to be seen by Django CMS, they must be wrapped up in a few templating tags, otherwise the page will not render and the site will crash. In adittion to that, EVERY. SINGLE. PAGE. that you expect to use in the site has to be registered both in your "views" and "urls" folder in order for the hyperlinks to work correctly.
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Which unfortunately actually brings me back to my original issue of not wanting to reinvent the wheel and manually change EVERY aspect of my site for a new entry. I think I've had my fill today when I realized I couldn't call a file in a different directory. I can see the tutorial on how to do it for HTML, and everytime I change something in the URLS file I seem to get closer, but the only way I can make the page behave is to crowd the "templates" folder. I am not sure why there is no other way I've found to reference this file. The closest I can get renders the file without any of the styling, so I have given up on trying altogether. Normally I wouldn't let a singular set back stop me from doing something, as I've been at this website project since April, but it just feels like the roadblocks I KEEP coming up against revolve around Django CMS as a technology, and I think I can finally just admit that this may not be the platform for me.
                                    So, I don't think I'll use Django CMS for the time being. Maybe I'm using it wrong, maybe it's the wrong platform for me, but I can't help but feel even if I were a seasoned developer, this seems a little too tedious for something that's supposed to be happening quickly
                                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">I never understood why some pepople talk about "The Django Way" but after a few weeks of rolling around in the documentation I think I can understand why now.</p>

                                                If you're going to lead a space frontier, it has to be government; it'll never be private enterprise. Because the space frontier is dangerous, and it's expensive, and it has unquantified risks.
